\subsection{Events}

\texttt{Event}s enable users to change molecule numbers outside of the solver loop at specific times~\reffigp{fig:events}. A \texttt{Simulation} instance handles both a \texttt{Solver} instance and an \texttt{EventHandler} instance. Every time an event timing is reached, the solver loop is stopped, the event(s) is (are) performed, the solver is reinitialized and the simulation resumes. Different \texttt{Event} implementations are offered to modify molecule numbers in a convenient way.

\subsection{Input/Output handling}

\subsubsection{Simulator Input}

The simulator needs the following to work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A general input file defining simulation parameters. A sample file is provided were all options are described (\textit{e.g.} length of simulation, what to output, algorithm variants). One important parameter is the location of the files the simulator should open to read reactants, reactions and events.
  \item An arbitrary number of files where reactants, reactions and events are declared. The simulator solves dependencies across files, it is not necessary to declare reactants in the same file as or before reactions using them.
\end{itemize}

Caution:
\begin{itemize}
\item All reactants must be declared in some file with their appropriate type (\textit{e.g.} \texttt{FreeChemical} or \texttt{BoundChemical}).
\item Multiple declarations are forbidden, a name cannot be reused.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulator Output}

Outputs provided by the simulator are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A general output file logging parametes used for simulation (input files used, random seed, algorithms used, etc.).
\item A concentration file with the number of molecules over time (for the chemicals and at a time step defined in the parameter file).
\item If a \texttt{DoubleStrand} was added in the chemicals to ouput, a replication file describing replication advancement of that \texttt{DoubleStrand}.
\end{itemize}
