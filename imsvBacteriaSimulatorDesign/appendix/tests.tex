\subsection{Testing philosophy}

Tests are usually divided in several categories. Because of the size of the project, the program includes three types of tests: \emph{programming by contract}, \emph{unit tests}, \emph{integration tests}~\reftabp{tab:tests}. They are designed to make the program fail as rapidly as possible and help find the origin of the problem.

\subsubsection{Programming by contract} 

These tests typically apply to attributes of classes and arguments of methods. They are usually divided into three subcategories: \emph{preconditions}, \emph{postconditions} and \emph{invariants}. They check whether the class interact correctly with the outside world, generally other classes.

\paragraph{Preconditions} Preconditions.
