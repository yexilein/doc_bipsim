\subsection{Implementations in MyCellS}

In MyCellS, the user can select between the direct method, the binary tree and
the hybrid method.
By default, the hybrid method is used to select the next reaction as it is the
most efficient method in practice.
Some reactions use the direct method implicitly
(\textit{e.g.} when a \texttt{Translocation} reaction is performed,
we select what \texttt{BoundUnit} to move with the direct method).

We provide two implementations for updating reaction rates.
The first implementation updates all rates at every step
(very inefficient but useful for debugging purposes).
The second implementation is based on the reactant to reaction graph.
It uses the observer pattern shown in \refsect{sec:detailed}.
