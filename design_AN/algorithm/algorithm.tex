\section{Implementations of Gillespie algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

In this section, we show the principles of the algorithms we implemented.
\citet{gillespie_perspective:_2013} propose a good review of the original Gillespie algorithm and some of its variants.
The original Stochastic Simulation Algorithm
(original name of the Gillespie algorithm)
can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item STEP 1: Update rate of reactions.
\item STEP 2: Select reaction to perform and next reaction time, perform reaction.
\end{itemize}

Most of the effort is spent on studying how to optimize the second step,
but we will see that the two steps are actually interrelated.
In a sense, the SSA and its variants are said to be (statistically) exact.

Our aim was to try various methods to optimize the second step of the SSA for a large biological system.
We reviewed the literature and implemented the main alternatives.
We provide some perspectives that could be worked on to improve the algorithms
or the way they interact with the updating step.
