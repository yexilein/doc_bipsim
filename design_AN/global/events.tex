\subsection{Events}

\texttt{Event}s enable users to change molecule numbers outside of the solver loop
at specific times~\reffigp{fig:events}.
A \texttt{Simulation} instance handles both a \texttt{Solver} instance and
an \texttt{EventHandler} instance.
Every time an event timing is reached, the solver loop is stopped,
the event(s) is (are) performed, the solver is reinitialized and the simulation resumes.
Different \texttt{Event} implementations are offered to modify molecule numbers in a convenient way.
