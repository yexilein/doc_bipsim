\subsubsection{Exchange with extracellular conditions}
Not described but a matter of changing the pool (concentrations probably for extracellular conditions) in volume and extracellular conditions. Works in both ways if needed.

\subsubsection{Exchange between volumes}
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{Not described but a matter of changing the pool in volumes. Works in both ways if needed. Just remind that for 'complex' entities, it is easier if everything is contained in one entity only. I mean, if a mRNA binded with a 70S and an AA 1 charged tRNA moves, then if only one entity contains all these information, it is much easier. Here we would have chosen the mRNA.}
