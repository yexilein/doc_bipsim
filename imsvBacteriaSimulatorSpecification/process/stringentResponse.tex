\paragraph{Biology} The stringent response is a fundamental regulation of the bacteria as it determines its response to environmental condition such amino acid starvation and stress. It determines the growth rate and acts on transcription and translation.

 \begin{description}
   \item[Transcription] it affects the ability of the polymerase to bind to the DNA for initiation;
   \item[Translation] it inhibs the ribosome  
 \end{description}
 It is based on the the inhibition of the ribosomes by RelA depending on the abundance of amino acids in the cytosol.
